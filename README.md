# Monkeytype Leaderboard Domination Bot üêí‚å®Ô∏è

Ever dreamed of being the fastest typer on Monkeytype? Well, dream no more! This bot uses Selenium to log into your Monkeytype account and break all the records. Made as a joke, this script will "automatically" help you reach the top of the leaderboard (although not quite legit).

## Features
- Logs into your Monkeytype account using Selenium WebDriver.
- "Types" at a superhuman speed to break all the records.
- Get to the top of the leaderboard in no time (as a joke of course).

## Disclaimer ‚ö†Ô∏è
This script is for educational and entertainment purposes only. Please use it responsibly. Cheating ruins the fun for others, and Monkeytype is a site where people challenge themselves to improve their typing skills. Use at your own risk!
